# Simple Backend with Express and Socket.io

## Express

* This server is mainly generated with express-generator, so almost all the code is actually generated code!

## Socket.io

* https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/

## Heroku

* I use heroku to have a fast deploy of this server, feel free to use any other service!
